## General Information
- This assignnment is to build a multiple regression model to the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company wants to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
    -   Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    -   How well those variables describe the bike demands
- We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- The dataset being used is called day.csv. 

## Conclusions
- Train R^2 :0.796
- Train Adjusted R^2 :0.783
- Test R^2 :0.777
- Test Adjusted R^2 :0.77
- Demand of bikes depend on year, temp, windspeed, sep, Light_snowrain, spring and winter.

## Technologies Used
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- statsmodel
